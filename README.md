## Usage
### Postman collection
Please refer to this [folder](./doc/api/postman).

You can import the workspace into your Postman.
There you will have two environments, one it's called `Dev` which to use you must have the server up and running in your machine.

The other one is the `Prod` environment, which is up to date with the main branch and it's hosted on Heroku.
