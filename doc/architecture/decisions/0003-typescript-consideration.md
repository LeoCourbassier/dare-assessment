# 3. Typescript consideration

Date: 2021-06-06

## Status

Rejected

## Context

Using TypeScript will provide more validation, resulting in a more trusty result of our application in production.
Also, any Javascript code is a valid TypeScript code, which wouldn't change the fact that this assignment should be in JavaScript.

## Decision

To have this project done in TypeScript instead of pure Javascript.

## Consequences

This change requires one to know how to code in TypeScript to have some effect over JavaScript. It would take more time but would assert correctness.

Once the boilerplate code is in TypeScript, the rest of the code is easy to implement.

## Notes

This project will be using JavaScript. 
It will happen this way because the assignment specifically requested it to be.
